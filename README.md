## Repository Structure Explained

### `src/`
Contains from-scratch implementations of fundamental deep learning components. This is the core of the repository, focused on clean, minimal, and modular implementations without experimental or exploratory code. All code present inside src is importable.

### `notebooks/`
Used for exploration, intuition building, and analysis of concepts implemented in `src/`. Includes derivations, comparisons, and experiments to better understand behavior and design choices.

### `experiments/`
Houses structured experiments designed to evaluate the impact of different design choices, such as optimizer behavior, initialization strategies, and activation functions.

### `benchmarks/`
Focused on performance and behavioral comparisons between custom implementations and PyTorch’s native implementations.

### `requirements.txt`
Lists dependencies required to run the implementations, experiments, and notebooks.

## Philosophy

- From-scratch implementations using PyTorch primitives  
- Clear separation: code vs experiments vs validation  
- Minimal, explicit, and readable implementations  
- Validate against PyTorch where possible  
- Focus on understanding over optimization

## Make code importable

You need to make sure you run the following command in order to run listed notebooks, tests, experiments on your local setup.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

OR 

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

This allows to register `pytorch-fundamentals` as an editable package with the help of `pyproject.toml` and allows the code present inside `src/` to be importable allowing for the notebooks, tests, experiments to run smoothly.

### Installation on Ubuntu/WSL

Recommended way:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### Alternative (Not-Recommended)
If you are using Ubuntu (including WSL), system Python is externally managed and blocks pip install.

You can override this restriction:

```bash
pip install --break-system-packages -e .
```

Use this only if:
- You understand the implications
- You are working on a personal machine
- You are willing to repair or reset your Python environment if needed
